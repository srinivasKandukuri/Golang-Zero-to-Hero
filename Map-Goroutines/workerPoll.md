🔄 Worker Pool – How It Works Internally
Let’s break it into two synchronized layers:

🧱 Components:
Job Queue (Channel) — shared queue where jobs are pushed.

Workers (Goroutines) — continuously wait and pull jobs from the queue.

🔁 Life of a Job
✅ Step-by-step breakdown:
1️⃣ Main creates a buffered channel (jobs := make(chan Job, N)):
Think of this as a mailbox where you can drop work.

Workers will pick up work from this box.

2️⃣ Main starts worker goroutines:
go
Copy
Edit
go worker(id, jobs, &wg)
Each worker is an infinite loop that:

Reads from the channel (for job := range jobs)

Processes the job

Waits again for the next job

3️⃣ Main sends jobs into the channel:
go
Copy
Edit
jobs <- Job{...}
Jobs are added to the channel.

If buffer is not full, the job goes in immediately.

If buffer is full, main blocks until a worker takes a job.

4️⃣ Worker receives the job:
go
Copy
Edit
for job := range jobs {
// process
}
The worker blocks on range jobs until something is available.

As soon as a job is sent, a waiting worker wakes up and processes it.

5️⃣ Main closes the job channel:
go
Copy
Edit
close(jobs)
This tells all workers: “No more jobs are coming.”

When the channel is closed and empty, range loop exits gracefully.

🧠 Key Insight
Workers wait for jobs.
Channels + for range loop give you automatic blocking behavior!

Worker is passive: It doesn’t ask for jobs. It just blocks on the channel.

Channel is the orchestrator: It queues jobs and wakes up waiting workers.

🔧 Visual Model
less
Copy
Edit
[ MAIN ] --> | job1 | job2 | job3 |   (channel buffer)
↓      ↓      ↓
[worker1][worker2][worker3]  (waiting on jobs)
As jobs are queued, each available worker pulls one and works.

If no jobs: workers just sleep (block).

If no free workers: main blocks if the buffer is full.

✅ Conclusion
So yes:

Workers wait for jobs to be assigned via a blocking read (<-chan) on the shared job channel.

It’s beautiful, simple concurrency 🍰
