/*
The sync.RWMutex in Go is a read-write mutex (mutual exclusion lock) that provides a way to safely manage concurrent access to shared data.
It is part of Go's sync package and is used to prevent data races.

âœ… 1. What Is a Mutex?
A mutex (short for mutual exclusion) is a synchronization primitive used to protect shared resources from
being accessed by multiple goroutines at the same time.

In simple terms:

Lock: Blocks other goroutines from accessing the resource.
Unlock: Allows other goroutines to access the resource.
âœ… 2. What Is sync.RWMutex?
sync.RWMutex is a read-write mutex that allows:

Multiple readers to access the resource simultaneously.
Only one writer to access the resource, while blocking all readers.
ðŸ‘‰ It is more efficient than a standard sync.Mutex when you have many reads but few writes.
